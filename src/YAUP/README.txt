See comments in code yaup.f and yayp.inc for specific changes.
Most important change:
    11/13 - RJD added save statement to routine rzextr to avoid GFORTRAN not
    saving local variables. (v1.3.3)

Also please notice that the Sun compiler generates codes which read the DOS
end-of-line control-M character and causes an error unless the input file
yaup.inp is first converted to Unix format. Conversion may be done with the
dos2unix text file format converter. The input file generated by the XOP 
is already in the Unix format and a conversion is not necessary.
